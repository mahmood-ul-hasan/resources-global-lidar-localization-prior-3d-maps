# resources-global-lidar-localization-prior-3d-maps
This repository curates and compares open-source methods for global LiDAR localization on a prior 3D point-cloud map (cold-start, no initial pose), as well as one-shot initial pose estimators you can feed into your favorite localizer (NDT/ICP/LIO), and local trackers that work best once a pose seed is available.
